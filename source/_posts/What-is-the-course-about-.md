#  What will students learn? 

Most students are unaware of the vast range of topics that they will cover while attending college. The breadth of material can be staggering, and it can be difficult to determine what you will actually learn in school. This article will outline the typical subjects that students study while in college, as well as what specific skills you will develop.

First and foremost, college provides a broad education in many different areas. Students typically take classes in humanities, mathematics, sciences, and social sciences. In addition, most schools have a wide variety of majors that students can choose from. This allows students to focus their studies on a particular area of interest.

While taking classes in these diverse subject areas, students also develop important skills. For example, critical thinking and analysis skills are fostered in humanities courses, while quantitative skills are developed in mathematics and science classes. In addition, oral and written communication skills are strengthened through coursework in all subject areas.

Overall, college provides a well-rounded education that prepares students for future careers or further study. Students gain a broad knowledge base as well as important critical thinking and communication skills. If you are unsure about what you will learn in college, this article should provide some clarity!
